    <p>This is the brownie recipe of your dreams if you want gooey, fudgy, decadent brownies with a shiny, crackly top.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cups granulated sugar </li>
        <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1½ cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease an 8×8-inch baking pan with baking spray and line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter in the microwave in 20-second intervals stirring between each one until fully melted, about 2 minutes. Add the sugar and cocoa and whisk vigorously for 30 seconds. Whisk in the eggs, vanilla, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and chocolate chips and mix together with a spatula until just combined. Spread the batter into the prepared pan. (You can sprinkle the top with more chocolate chips, if desired.)</li>
        <li>Bake for about 35 to 40 minutes, inserting a toothpick into the center to check doneness, and removing it with several moist crumbs for fudgy brownies or only a few crumbs for cakey brownies. Let the brownies cool completely in the pan before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
